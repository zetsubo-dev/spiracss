## Overview

**No More Memorizing CSS Architecture.**<br>
Parents decide children's layout. Children only style their internals.

SpiraCSS is a CSS architecture based on one concept: the parent decides the child's layout; the child only styles its internals.<br>
The HTML structure determines the correct way to write styles, and Stylelint validates both humans and AI with the same criteria.

## Features

- **Structure shows the answer** — Parent or child—where does this style go? The HTML structure already knows.
- **Full Stylelint validation** — No need to memorize detailed rules. The tooling tells you.
- **AI-agent first design** — Error messages optimized for AI. Fixes can be automated.
