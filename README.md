# SpiraCSS

**No More Memorizing CSS Architecture.**

The parent decides the child's layout; the child only styles its internals.

SpiraCSS is a CSS architecture based on this single principle — design resilience, not rules.

> [See How It Works](https://spiracss.jp/architecture/principles/)

CSS design tends to rely on conventions, and consistency erodes as teams scale.
SpiraCSS keeps the architecture intact — structure and Stylelint enforce it.
No new CSS features like `@scope` or `@layer` required. Just familiar SCSS.

Not a better ruleset — a fundamentally different approach.

## Features

- **Structure decides placement** — No judgment calls. The answer lies in HTML structure.
- **Designed to hold** — Not conventions to memorize. An architecture that stays intact.
- **AI-agent ready** — Error messages designed for AI agents. Supports AI-driven fixes.
