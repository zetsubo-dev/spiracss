# SpiraCSS

**No More Memorizing CSS Architecture.**

The parent decides the child's layout; the child only styles its internals.

SpiraCSS is a CSS architecture based on this single principle. Stylelint validates both humans and AI agents with the same criteria.

## Features

- **Structure gives the answer** — Where does this style belong? The HTML structure already knows.
- **Full Stylelint validation** — No need to memorize detailed rules. The tooling tells you.
- **AI-agent-first design** — Error messages optimized for AI agents. Supports AI-agent-assisted fixes.
