# SpiraCSS

**No More Memorizing CSS Architecture.**

The parent decides the child's layout; the child only styles its internals.

SpiraCSS is a CSS architecture based on this single principle. HTML structure decides where styles belong — Stylelint validates it automatically.

## Features

- **Structure decides placement** — No judgment calls. The answer lies in HTML structure.
- **Stylelint validates it** — Not a guideline to follow. A constraint the toolchain checks.
- **AI-agent ready** — Error messages designed for AI agents. Supports AI-driven fixes.
