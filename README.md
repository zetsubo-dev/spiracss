# SpiraCSS

**No More Memorizing CSS Architecture.**

The parent decides the child's layout; the child only styles its internals.

SpiraCSS is a CSS architecture based on this single principle. HTML structure decides where styles belong — Stylelint validates it automatically.

Many CSS methodologies rely on conventions, and consistency tends to erode as teams scale.
SpiraCSS lets HTML structure decide placement. Stylelint reports actionable errors.
They're clear to both humans and AI agents.
No new CSS features like `@scope` or `@layer` required. Just familiar SCSS.

## Features

- **Structure decides placement** — No judgment calls. The answer lies in HTML structure.
- **Stylelint validates it** — Not a guideline to follow. A constraint the toolchain checks.
- **AI-agent ready** — Error messages designed for AI agents. Supports AI-driven fixes.
